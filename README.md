# Visual Data

In this project i will explore the exciting world of stock visualization using Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a powerful open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and explanatory text.

Stock visualization is a fundamental aspect of analyzing and understanding stock market trends, patterns, and performance. By visualizing stock data, I can gain insights into price movements, volume trends, and correlations, enabling us to make informed investment decisions. 

In this project, I will cover the following topics:

1. Importing necessary libraries and data (stock_market.xlsx)
2. Exploring the stock data
3. Plotting stock price trends
4. Visualizing volume trends
5. Analyzing moving averages
6. Plotting candlestick charts
7. Adding technical indicators
8. Making the dashboard interactive to the users
